# AI Automated Release [WIP]


### Description 
A DevOps app geared towards implementing automation into the software feature release process. Inspired by a QA perspective for limiting the manual steps needed before any testing is performed and allows that the developer to focus on the actual monitoring of test results and behavior of what is expected.


### Technologies Used:
- Javascript (language)
- MongoDB (DB for tracking release details across system)
- OpenAI's beta assistant API (summarizes epic and story descriptions)
- Atlassian's Forge Platform (Platform for which entire system is built on that also uses JIRA Cloud, JIRA Management, and Confluence APIs)
